    <p class="steve"> Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object cause it doesn't have a window to draw anything.<br>
        "location" object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn't require that.<br>
        Ofcourse Node doesn't have "document" object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.<br>
        Node has "global", which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.<br>
        "require" object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.<br>
        In Node everything is a module. You must keep your code inside a module.	 Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers.
 Node is headless

       <h2 style="color: blue;">browser</h2>
       <p class="steve1">"window" is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.<br>
        "location" is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.<br>
        "document", which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.<br>
        Browsers may have an object named "global", but it will be the exact one as "window".<br>
        Browsers don't have "require" predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.<br>
        Browsers processes response objects.
